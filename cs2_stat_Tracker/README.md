# cs2_stat_Tracker


## Name
Stat tracker for the game Counter-strike 2.

## Description
This was initially part of a course I took, but couldnt finish it in time, so i finished it during my freetime. The design is object oriented but not "fully".
Followed statistics: kda, win/loss and weapon stats. Might add more later.
The program needs your steam web api key to function, so if you feel uneasy about sharing it just dont use the program. 
Source code is provided so you can verify that no funny business for example caching api keys is not happening :) (also feel free to contact if you find some flaws with the program)

## Usage
Terminal/text based help command included.

## Support
will try to read/respond to reports flaws/bugs that might be found and fix them.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Konsta Lahtinen, Konstig70.

## License

## Project status
Almost finished working with certain quality of life updates.
