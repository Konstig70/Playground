# DynamicComboBox

## Description
DynamicComboBox is a upgraded version of JavaFX ComboBox component. 
Implements a dynamic addition to new items and automatic content filteration.
Fully implemented in SceneBuilder, you can now add items directly in SceneBuilder (gone are the days of having to set items with ComboBox.setItems()) and toggle other features like filtering or dynamic addition there.
This component was part of a bigger project i did during my studies and it even got added as part of the course! 

## Usage
Download the DynamicComboBox.jar file and add it to your IDE and SceneBuilder.
Note. since, the setItems method is done as a final method i wasnt possible to override it. So for adding items directly in code use DynamicComboBoxes own methods such as asetaSisalto, setItems is still usable, but doesnt work properly.
Also if you plan on using this on a public project giving credit would be highlyappreciated :)
